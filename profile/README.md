## Hi there 👋

We created Tux Display as an open and privacy focused smart dipslay to rival the Big Tech companies that can do whatever they want with your data. 
This project was created by four high school students in the Netherlands and is currently not being actively supported so some files might not work.
We based our smart display off of [MycroftAI](https://mycroft.ai/) furthermore we added our own skills, like an automatic skills cloner and a nice looking homescreen.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
